# Snake

# Description
The game "Snake" is a game in which an imaginary snake moves on the playing field, bypassing obstacles and it needs to hit the target (eat an apple).
The player controls the snake with the arrow keys. When the snake interacts with the wall, or hit yourself, the game ends and the program displays
loss notification accompanied by appropriate music. With each interaction with the apple, the snake gradually increases by one cell.
 With each interaction with the apple, a new apple appears on the playing field. After each "eating" of apples, the score increases by 1.
Scores are displayed in the upper right corner. If the score is higher than 7 and 15, an additional wall appears on the playing field.
